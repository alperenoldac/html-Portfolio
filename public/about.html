<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a first-year software engineering student at Adana Alparslan Türkeş Science and
  Technology University, with a strong interest in software and technology. I am passionate
  about learning new technologies and I am always looking for ways to challenge myself. I
  am also a team player and I enjoy working with others to solve problems.
  Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active through riding a bike and playing soccer,
  which helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle and fresh perspective.</p>
